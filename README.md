# chess
A high school JS/HTML project creating a Chess game. This was one of my first JavaScript projects and, as such, is not perfectly optimized/styled JS.

The game is local and two-player. The board shows all available moves when a piece is selected. It also enfoces moves and turn validity. It detects some checkmates, although that feature was never fully finished.
