# Chess
A high school JS/HTML project creating a Chess game. This was one of my first JavaScript projects and, as such, is not perfectly optimized/styled JS.

The game is local and two-player. The board shows all available moves when a piece is selected. It also forces legal moves and keeps track of the active player. It was never fully finshed, and has some castling and checkmate bugs.
